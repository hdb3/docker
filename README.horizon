THIS COMMAND EXPOSES BOTH apache and django ports, though apache is not fully functional due to some confusion about all of the 'static' assets.

The django standalone server starts automnatically: the command could equally br run as a daemon (-d rtahter than -it).


docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 8080:80 --add-host=controller:10.30.65.210 -it hdb3/horizon
